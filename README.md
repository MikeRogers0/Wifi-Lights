# Wifi Lights controller

I picked up some wifi controled lights a little while ago & I always thought it would be cool to control them via the web.

I'm ditching a RoR implimentation, I have a dynamic IP at home so running this on on Heroku would be tricky. I'm going to try and make an app for my iPad to handle this instead.

## Todo
* RubyMotion this!

## Reference material
* http://www.philippinestuffs.com/milight-wifi-controlled-light-bulbs/ - This fella documented the UPD codes I need to send.
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdy.client.remoteLed - The app I'd idealy like to replace.
