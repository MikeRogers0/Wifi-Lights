# Wifi Lights controller

I picked up some wifi controled lights a little while ago & I always thought it would be cool to control them via the web.

## Todo
* Setup the lights controller box to be accessable by heroku.
* Make some kind of ruby wrapper to send the commands to the controller box
* Setup heroku scheduler to see if the lights are accessable in the morning, then turn them on https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler
* Setup sweet startup with just a video of me getting out of bed.

## Reference material
* http://www.philippinestuffs.com/milight-wifi-controlled-light-bulbs/ - This fella documented the UPD codes I need to send.
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdy.client.remoteLed - The app I'd idealy like to replace.
